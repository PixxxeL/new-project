# Create New Project

This batch file intended for create project skeleton on my Windows station.
You may use it also. To do:
* Type password of your bitbucket repository in `.pwd` file
* Set variables `app_path` where new-project.bat live, `py_pro` where Python's projects live, `py_pro_st` same py_pro but for Sublime, `php_pro` and `php_pro_st` - for PHP projects, `repo_user` - user login from Bitbucket.
* I'm use Sublime Text for coding. Install it.
* You must install cURL for Windows and Git Bash for Windows.
* Also need Virtual Environment for Python.
Script download `new-client.bat` in `repo/client` directory of created project. Run it for set client environment.
